                    I hold a master degree and a PhD in architecture from IUST, 
                    one of the most prestigious universities of Iran, Tehran. 
                    During my academic studies, I was always an outstanding student 
                    and honored to be continuously the member of 'Iran Community of National 
                    Talents'. My professional life has embraced architectural practice and 
                    research as well as teaching at some well-known universities 
                    in Iran over fourteen years now. I have won a number of architectural 
                    competitions, led many important research projects and nationally 
                    been recognized as a distinguished university professor. I have been 
                    the chief concept designer of a number of quite important landscape and 
                    architectural projects. I have designed a new method of architectural 
                    design for which I have dedicated ten years of profoundly studying philosophy, 
                    history, sociology, psychology, biology, physics, etc, the method that 
                    I believe is worth of being presented at international academies. 
                    My method is about an intelligent way of designing in which 
                    free-hand sketching, being half-real, half-imaginary, visionary, touched 
                    by the point of view and individuals' standpoints, can surpass rigid and 
                    predefined computer-aided perspective drawing, yet allow the designer more 
                    freedom and flexibility. It might be worth mentioning that my excellent 
                    and extensively admired skill in architectural <span>free-hand 
                    sketching</span> could have contributed to the development of this idea.
                    </p>
                    <div className="infoImg" ><img className="imageOne" alt="" /></div>
                    <p>
                    This method embraces both research and design domains. At the first part, 
                    the way blind forces of Capital, Mode and Meme are unconsciously forming 
                    our urban structures is studied, and then <span>landscape</span> and public spaces as 
                    forces to effectively help realize civil rights and urban democracy through 
                    <span></span> design mediums are looked at in terms of their role in directing those 
                    free access of all to light and landscape throughout the city.
                    <br/>
                    The second part suggests a method of urban landscape design based 
                    on a technique of intelligent and evolving sketching which concerns
                    both simultaneous(parallel) and sequential processes of design. 
                    It employs the strengths of both methods while removing the weaknesses. 
                    This method provides a new system in which landscape and public spaces 
                    are no longer ineffective and dormant things encircled by buildings. 
                    They, instead, possesses an independent character, not only define the way 
                    buildings are arranged but decide the form, height, entrances and access of 
                    buildings to the city.
                    <br/>
                    Along with successful experiences in teamwork and leading design teams, I am 
                    quite well known among the Tehran community of architects to be highly competent 
                    in accomplishing the whole architectural design of large projects from the concept 
                    design to the presentation in a short time.
